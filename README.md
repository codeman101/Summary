# Capstone
https://github.com/codeman101/Capstone This is my Capstone project I did in college. Based off my interest in computer security it's a trojan I created with the Qt framework. When the user starts the program it asks the user it can install two programs, CCleaner and Defragger. It then popus up with a window consisting of two buttons. One says "Run CCleaner" and the other says "Run Defraggler" When user clicks on either button it runs the repective program but also puts a C++ executable in Startup Porgrams folder.  Upon reboot the executable calls itself and enters an infinite loop allocating memory infinitly.
# SiteChecker
https://github.com/codeman101/SiteChecker This a Python script that sends search queries from a query generator to the DuckDuckGo search engine. It then takes the results and checks them against VirusTotal to see if any of them are malicious sites.
# SiteChecker-User-Input version
https://github.com/codeman101/SiteChecker-User-Input-Version This is the same as the pervious except instead of using a generator for the search queries it asks the user for a search query.
# ImageScrapper
https://github.com/codeman101/imageScrapper This is a Python script that asks the user for a url and a folder name. It then downloads images it find from the url and stores them in a folder with the name that was provided by the user.
# RaidImitator
https://github.com/codeman101/RaidImitator This is a C# program I made for a friend. It reads from a file that has a source and destionation path. The program then mimics the the source directory with the destination directory essentially creating a copy of the source directory that updates in realtime.
# FileMonitor
https://github.com/codeman101/FileMonitor This is another C# program I made for a friend. It's a collection of two programs that work together. The first program called FileLogger. It takes a file or directory path as a second argument from the user unpon executiing the program and logs that file or directory path to a file. The second program called FileMonitor reads the paths from that file and checks if the files or directories are 14 days. If they are then they are deleted and removed from the file list.
# ImageDownloader
https://github.com/codeman101/ImageDownloader This is a JavaScript firefox extension. When the user clicks on the icon of the extension it makes the images on the given page downloadable with a single click so when the user clicks an image the familar download prompt appears for that image. 
# MusicFilesApp
https://github.com/codeman101/musicFilesApp This a C++ program I made for my Dad. It asks the user for their username so it can get to their user directory and asks what iTunes playlist they want the program to work with. It then goes to the iTunes generated XML file to get the file paths of the files in playlist and copies the files to a folder on the users desktop.
